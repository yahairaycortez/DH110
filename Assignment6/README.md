 ## Project Brief & Key Tasks

### Purpose
The purpose of the project is to improve the <a href="https://www.guitartricks.com/home.php" target="_blank">Guitar Tricks </a> site to enhance site navigation and increase user accesiblity and engagement, while considering the site's mission and the needs of their audience. The <a href="https://www.guitartricks.com/home.php" target="_blank">Guitar Tricks </a> site is an online music learning resrouce for learning guitar and appeals to players of all levels and all ages. Therefore with the redesign, the site should be able to better accomodate to those who fall within the music learning category, regardless of age. <br>

The purpose of the interface design is to work towards finalizing the product design by converting low-fidelity designs to high-fidelity. The high-fidelity designs begin to consider the visual and interactive components of the product design. 

### Key Tasks 
Users of <a href="https://www.guitartricks.com/home.php" target="_blank">Guitar Tricks</a> should be able to:
 - Access and Complete any Guiar Lessons of their choosing (Fundamentals, Songs, Exercises, etc.)
 - Check their Lesson Progress
 - Utilize Question Forum 
 
## Interface

### Approach 
I approached the design with an empahsis on modern interface design and consideration for the target audience, middle-aged males, musicians or those seeking to learn music. For the high-fidelity design, I drew inspiration from the original <a href="https://www.guitartricks.com/home.php" target="_blank">Guitar Tricks</a> site as well as from <a href="https://app.flowkey.com/songs" target="_blank">FlowKey</a>, another online music learning resource. 

I used Figma to draft and finalize the high-fidelity designs. Because the site is for often used on a computer, I based my frame dimensions for the design off the screen dimensions of the Macbook Pro "14.

In finalizing the high-fidelity design above, I iterated through different types of typography, colors, and shapes to test and evaluate the types of elements to use within the design. <br>

## Typography Iteration

My exploration of typography was based on whether they fit within the modern interface image and if they were more playful yet professional. <br>

I decided on Rubik because, in comparison to the others I explored, I felt it did well in moderninizng the feel of the interface while doing well in combining the playful or lighthearted elements with still a sharp, professional edge to it. The others I tried were either too round and seemed almost too playful or more geared towards a younger audience, while others felt more serious which took away from the fun and engaging nature of guitar learning content. <br>

## Shape Iteration

I knew when exploring the types of shapes to use within the interface I wanted to focus on more round shapes. More round shapes do well in creating a more modern feel to the site, versus sharp straight lines that can decrease engagment and again take away from the fun and engaging nature of the site's content. <br>

Because most of the site's contents are buttons or video thumbnails, I decided on a 40px roundness. Because we often associate buttons with more round edges, the shapes of the objects on the site not only contribute to the site's overall impression but also encourages users to press on the buttons, thus increasing user engagement. The 40px does well in softening the feel of the site, but is still sharp enough to maintain the slight professional tone of the site as some of guitar content is taught by well accomplished professionals. <br>
