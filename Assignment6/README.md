The <a href="https://www.guitartricks.com/home.php" target="_blank">Guitar Tricks </a> site is an online music learning resrouce for learning guitar and appeals to players of all levels and all ages.

## Interface

### Approach 
I approached the design with an empahsis on modern interface design and consideration for the target audience, middle-aged males, musicians or those seeking to learn music. For the high-fidelity design, I drew inspiration from the original <a href="https://www.guitartricks.com/home.php" target="_blank">Guitar Tricks</a> site as well as from <a href="https://app.flowkey.com/songs" target="_blank">FlowKey</a>, another online music learning resource. 

I used Figma to draft and finalize the high-fidelity designs. Because the site is for often used on a computer, I based my frame dimensions for the design off the screen dimensions of the Macbook Pro "14.
