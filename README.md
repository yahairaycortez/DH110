## Project Brief 

### Purpose
Whether it is a sense of nostalgia or simply a new curiosity, learning a musical instrument is a common hobby, and has been for decades. With the creation of the online music learning services, music learning has become much more accessible. However, the accessibility of such services may be hindered by how the technology of the service is utilized. 

The music learning service I will aim to improve for my UX project is GuitarTricks.com. 
The Guitar Tricks site is an online music learning resource for learning guitar, and whose mission is to provide guitar learning services for all ages and all skill levels. With my UX project, 
I intend to enhance site navigation and increase user accessibility while ensuring the high quality of the musical teaching or music learning content. In creating the redesign of GuitarTricks, the siteâ€™s mission and the needs of their audience, such as technological gaps, will be taken into consideration. For the DH110 course,  my project will especially consider the needs of those who meet the following profile: Middle-Aged (40-60 years old), Employed, Males, Some Education.
