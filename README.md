### Purpose
Whether it is a sense of nostalgia or simply a new curiosity, learning a musical instrument is a common hobby, and has been for decades. With the creation of the online music learning services, music learning has become much more accessible. However, the accessibility of such services may be hindered by how the technology of the service is utilized. 

The music learning service I will aim to improve for my UX project is <a href="https://www.guitartricks.com/" target="_blank">GuitarTricks.com</a>.
The Guitar Tricks site is an online music learning resource for learning guitar, and whose mission is to provide guitar learning services for all ages and all skill levels. With my UX project, 
I intend to enhance site navigation and increase user accessibility while ensuring the high quality of the musical teaching or music learning content. In creating the redesign of GuitarTricks, the siteâ€™s mission and the needs of their audience, such as technological gaps, will be taken into consideration. For the DH110 course,  my project will especially consider the needs of those who meet the following profile: Middle-Aged (40-60 years old), Employed, Males, Some Education. 

### Design Statement 
<b>Through my UX project, I hope to design a music learning service that is easy to navigate, regardless of technological familiarity with websites, easy to search, and, most importantly, engaging for learners. The design of the website should coincide with the site's mission - accessible to all ages and players of all skill levels. </b> <br>
  
After conducting usability testing and research (mentioned below), I decided to prioritze certain features of the site in the redesign:
  - <b> Minimizing Visual Noise </b>
  - <b> Modernizing Website Interface </b>
  - <b> Key Tasks can be Easily Accomplished, Users can: </b>
    - Access Lessons
    - Access Lesson Progress
    - Question Forum/Search Bar can be accessed and utilized effectively <br><br>

## Competitor Analysis 
### Heuristic Evaluation
To understand how other music learning sites presented and performed, specifically those that were intended to teach musical instruments, I conducted heuritisic analysis on two instrument learning sites: <a href="https://www.guitartricks.com/" target="_blank">GuitarTricks.com</a> and <a href="https://www.flowkey.com/en" target="_blank">FlowKey.com</a>. <br> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <img src="images/guitartrickslogo.png" width= "100px" height="100px"> &nbsp; <img src="images/flowkeylogo.png" width= "100px" height="100px"> <br><br>
I chose to evaluate the sites because of how they differed in their design interface and their prominence within the realm of online music learning. The herusitic evaluations on the sites were conducted according to  <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/" target="_blank">10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design</a> and <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-to-rate-the-severity-of-usability-problems/" target="_blank"> Severity Ratings for Usability Problems</a>.<br/>
From the two online music learning services, I found I wanted to create a design that was a balance between the honorable qualities of each website - high quality lessons offered through a simple, modern interface. Both sites overall offered useful music learning tools, but certain aspects of the sites, such as interface design and variety in music lessons, were executed better between one or the other. Thus, I wanted an interface design that was inspired by the balance of the two sites, or a combination of the honorable qualities of each site.
