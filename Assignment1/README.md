 DH 110: User Experience Design <br>

## Tentative Title: YouTune

It is no surprise at any age or stage in life, one might feel the need to learn music, especially learning a musical instrument. Whether it is a sense of nostalgia or simply a new curisoity, learning a musical insturment is a common hobby, and has been for decades. As someone who has grown up learning insturments, however, I can testify to the difficulty in learning an instrument, moreso when without access to in-person instructors. Especially during times like today, in-person instructors may be not always be an viable option, which makes online music learning services/app even more crucial. 

Online music learning services provides better access to those who seek to learn a musical instrument, however, the accesibility may be hindered by how the techonology of the service is utilized. With my UX project, I want to make online music learning serivces, specifically those teaching musical instruments, easy to navigate without hindering the quality of musical teaching. I want my project to especially take into account older audiences, such as middle-aged men, and redesign the interface such that the majority of those within the group are better able to utilize the music learning service.<br/> 
 
The following evaluations are based using <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/" target="_blank">10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design</a> and <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-to-rate-the-severity-of-usability-problems/" target="_blank"> Severity Ratings for Usability Problems</a>.<br/>

**Evaluation:** Overall the webstie is simple and easy to naviagte, however, might be too simple for inexperienced users. The lack of guidance can make it difficult for those who may not be as experienced with technology. The sizing of the text may also hinder the ability of users who have difficulty seeing. <br/> <br/>
