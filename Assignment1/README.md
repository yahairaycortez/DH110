# Assignment 1: Heuristic Evaluation | Yahaira Cortez - DH110

## Tentative Title: YouTune

It is no surprise at any age or stage in life, one might feel the need to learn music, especially learning a musical instrument. Whether it is a sense of nostalgia or simply a new curisoity, learning a musical insturment is a common hobby, and has been for decades. As someone who has grown up learning insturments, however, I can testify to the difficulty in learning an instrument, moreso when without access to in-person instructors. Especially during times like today, in-person instructors may be not always be an viable option, which makes online music learning services/app even more crucial. 

Online music learning services provides better access to those who seek to learn a musical instrument, however, the accesibility may be hindered by how the techonology of the service is utilized. With my UX project, I want to make online music learning serivces, specifically those teaching musical instruments, easy to navigate without hindering the quality of musical teaching. I want my project to especially take into account older audiences, such as middle-aged men, and redesign the interface such that the majority of those within the group are better able to utilize the music learning service.<br/>
