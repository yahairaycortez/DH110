## DH110 Assignment 3 - Contextual Inquiry 

#### Yahaira Cortez // GuitarTricks // Music Learning + Guitar

## ☑ Step 1: Research Goal & Requirements 
### •  What is the main activity your project would support for the users?
  - The project will supoprt users in learning how to play guitar, or strengthen and advance guitar skills. 
### •  What is the basic need/goal involved for that activity? 
  -  This activity can fulfill the user’s esteem needs as well as feelings of purpose. Because learning a skill requires dedication and motivation, the user may feel a sense of accomplishment when making progress. Additonally, because learning an instrument could be considered a hobby or extracuriccular, the user may find a sense of purpose outside of everyday work and/or school, especially for those of an older demographic. Overall, the activity allows the user an outlet that not only promotes good self esteem but provides a sense of purpose. 
### • What are the traditional/current solutions to satisfy the needs?
  - There are various types of ways one may learn guitar, online or offline. A more traditional approach of learning guitar is from learning from someone, in-person, whether it be an instructor or someone you may know that happens to know how to play guitar. More current solutions are online services, such as websties and apps, that offer online lessons or tutorials on how to learn and strengthen guitar skills. 
  - However, considering each user may prefer a specific learning style, it is difficult to find or create online services that are able to meet the needs of the majority of users. Even more traditional methods of teaching guitar may not seem as convenient as many may not able to meet an instructor in-person and not many are able to dedicate time to meeting 1 on 1 with an instructor consistently. 
  - The current available solutions, especially online solutions, do not meet the needs of the demographic we are targeting, which is older males. 
  
### • What are the limitations that possibly would be improved with techonology?
  - One of the biggest limitations is offering the correct style of learning. Regardless of the preferrerd style of learning, such as visual, auditory, etc, the user should be able to still benefit from the service because it offers services that meet the needs of most learning styles.
  - Because the cirriculum may differ between instructors, it is important to understand what is necessary for the user in order to learn guitar and how they are able to work their way towards becoming an advanced plater to then create a more universal cirriculum. <br>


## ☑ Step 2: Target Users
### •  What are the characteristics of users?
  - Demographics: Middle-Aged (40-60 years old), Employed, Males, Some Education
  - Preferences: Users have an interest in learning how to play guitar, or users have a bit of experience with guitar and are interested in strengthening their skills 
  - Expertise: Users may have little to no expertise on the activity
 ### •  In which context would the users do that activity?
 - The user would do the activity when they seek a method of learning, or strengthening, guitar skills and tracking their progress. Users should be motivated to learning, espeically if they are new to guitar. 
 - If the user perfers an online method they should have access to internet, a computer, a guitar, working micorphone, and an environment where they could practice and learn the skills being taught online. 
 - If the user prefers an in-person method of learning, they should have a means of transporation (to arrive at instructor location), a guitar, and a pencil for marking music. 
 ### • What would the users usually do in order to complete that activity?
 - The user will need to access their learning environment (whether it be an online service or an in-person instructor) and have access to their guitar. With their guitar they should be able to follow along and learn from the guitar learning instruction (either in-person or online). 


## ☑ Step 3: Research Methods
### Methods 
The 2 Research Methods I used were an *Interview* and *Covert Observation*.
##### <b><i>Covert Observation</i></b>
 - For the *Covert Observation* I decided on observing the UCLA Marching Band when learning new music. I observed their behaviors and processes for learning and rehearsing new music that is presented to them. 
 - From my research I found:
    - Many players tend to practice the notes first and then work towards the rhythm. 
    - If the song is popular they will first practice the notes then add on the rhythm based on their prior knowledge of the original song. 
    - Many will skim through the sheet music and rehearse the music snippet by snippet. 
    - If they have access to a recording, they will first try to play the music on their own then they will be play the recording to check their progress and also as a guide for playing along. 
    - They will try to learn from others by ear - they will listen for others to play and learn by ear from them.
    - Some may review and mark their music with fingerings or music annotations. 
##### <b><i>Interview</i></b>
- For the *Interview* I interviewed a 24 year-old male with some experience with Guitar.

### Interesting Interview Highlights
- The Basics for Guitar Learning (07:27)
  - > (Besides Finger Patterns) I try to practice scales. That's just to me, I think that's just the whole bread and butter to playing guitar. If you can master your scales and get your chord progressions down, I think you'll be a fantastic player.
- Realizing they Needed to Master the Guitar Foundations before Advancing (54:15)
  - > No, seriously. When I first asked for the guitar, my whole intent was just like, me personally, I was like songs bro. Like, screw scales, screw all the conventional stuff... Like, man, I didn't really care about the notes. I just want to learn songs. But it hit me like a truck. I was like, all right, I got to learn these chord progressions. I got to learn these scales. It's going to help me out in the long run.
- Tracking Progress and Basing their Next Music Learning Session on prior Progress (38:03)
  - > It's just a checkmark and X system...That's how I keep it to me. It's like how I visually see my progress. I'm like, okay, I'm obviously I'm trying to shoot more green, and red also helps me keep track to say it's like, all right, Monday, I'm going to practice chord progression. Tuesday, I'm going to focus on my stretch Wednesday, I'm going to focus on my scales...
- They like to Play Along with Recordings and Find it Most Beneficial (15:16) & (55:21) & (56:20)
  - > And next thing you know, I was just following along before I knew it, and I was like, Whoa, wait a second, hold on. I pause the video, and next thing you know, that helped me out tremendously. More than visual learning.
  - > Just listening to music live. Even if I don't have my guitar, I'll always try to mimic and try to follow along. And I'll also use, like, my feet or my foot. I'll use 1 foot just to help me keep count.
  - > I mean, no, just like my notebook and just kind of listen by ear and utilizing the radio... I try to have YouTube as my last resort for me
- Finger Stretching and Finger Patterns are considered an Essential for Guitar Learning (20:58) & (48:28) 
  - > Specifically? Like the finger methods? Like, to me, I just think the most underrated part of (playing) is your transition to chords, literally. That's how you make nice sounds. It doesn't sound like when you're playing of course. 
  - >  Literally, I wasn't able to stretch my fingers out in the beginning. I wasn't capable of just stretching my hand out. So I kind of just had to put myself in some uncomfortable situations and minor pain or just like, oh, okay, I'm begging my fingers in this awkward way, but I'm making beautiful sounds.
