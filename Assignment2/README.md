## Yahaira Cortez

### Introduction - Initial Evaluation
<b>GuitarTricks</b> is an online website for learning to play guitar. The website offers online video lessons for players ranging from beginner to advanced. Users are able to take lessons depending on their guitar skill level or learn specific songs of their interest on guitar. 

After conducting an inital evalutation, I found a number of usability issues with the <b>GuitarTricks</b> website:
- <b>Website Interface Inconsistencies</b>
  - Buttons for navigating site are not always located in the same areas and often change when navigating between pages. Website interface is not consistent with more current designs of web interfaces. 

 - <b>Difficulty in Locating Site Features</b> <br>
   - Difficult to locate basic site features such as exiting lesson, entering lesson, and question forum. 
 - <b>Diffculty in Navigating Question Forums</b> (Help & Documentation) <br>
   - The number of posts and threads posted on Question Forum can be overwhelming and the search functions (such as search icon and search function within Question forum) do not do well in filtering through results relating to the search. 
 - <b>Visibility of System Status</b> <br>
  - Progress status is not easily visible and user is not aware whether their progress is saved or not. 


### User Testing
Because of the usability issues we found in the initial evaluation, we went ahead and conducted a usability test for the website <b>GuitarTricks</b>. The usability test serves to evaluate a product or service by testing it with representative users. Such as the term usability suggests, the test will be evaluating the capability of the product to perform its intended use and test whether the product is able to allow users to use the app (in this case website) in a safe, effective, enjoyable, and efficient manner (<a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/usability-101-introduction-to-usability/" target="_blank">Cite</a>). From the test we are then able to redesign or fix the flaws of the website in order to meet the needs of the user. To evaluate the true usability of the website, we asked the user to complete tasks that a typical user of <b>GuitarTricks</b> would complete when using the website.

### User Testing Methodology
The Usability Test on the site <b>GuitarTricks</b> was conducted in Westwood, CA using a portable minimalistic lab. My participant used a laptop to complete the UT Survey and to test the <b>GuitarTricks</b> site. The laptop was also used to record the participant's facial expressions as well as their usability on the site. <br>

Before completing any tasks with the site, the moderator will first introduce the participant to the study, explain informed consent, and ask for their consent to participate in the study and to use their information to find potential improvements. The moderator will then ask the participant to complete pre-questions that survey the participant on their initial impressions of different pages of the site. Once the pre-questions are complete, the moderator will then ask the participant to complete 4 tasks while speaking aloud their thought process while completing tasks. Once all tasks are completed, the participant will complete post-questions which survey the participant's opinions on the usability of the site, the efficiency of the site, expected frequency of use, learnability, aesthetics, content organization, and overall feelings of the site. Lastly, the participant will share demographic information, which will be kept confidential.
